Warning
-------
This library is only lols. Do not trust the library. The library will only dissapoint you. This library does not strictly adhere to the balmer curve.


Legal
-----
I will sue anyone who slanders this library. In the face.


But Seriously Though
--------------------
This is a jQuery/Zepto ripoff in about 1kb gzipped. If you can barely justify including a DOM library in your project, this might be the one to try.  
If you find this library wandering around in a drunken/drugged stuper, please impeach it and carry on with your day.
